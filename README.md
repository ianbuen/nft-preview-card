## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow 

### What I learned

I'm no expert in Sass, so I've gotten rusty. But still the best time to use a style pre-processor, than never. I've relearned the basics, such as using mixins, nesting, and inheritance.


### Continued development

I am yet to dig deeper into the features of Sass. Pretty sure I was just at the tip of the iceberg. Looking forward to utilizing Sass for easier styling.

### Useful resources

- [Official Sass Guide](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - This helped me get up to speed with setting up Sass as well as the basics.
